    "section": "Analysis",
    "text": "Analysis\nTo test if reaction time is affected by the hand used and eye used, we would carry out a two-way ANOVA test. We will use the ANOVA test because there are two factors involved; hand used and eye used. We could use two t-tests but that would increase the probability of get errors, so an ANOVA, which is just one test, would be preferred.\n\nHypotheses\nThis analysis will use a two-way ANOVA with the factors of Hands, and Eyes and their interaction. Thus, we have three sets of hypotheses that need to be stated in order to understand the effect of each on Reaction time.\n\nDoes the hand used affect Reaction?\n\nFactor: Hand with levels \\(right\\)(r) and \\(left\\)(l). \\[\n  H_0: \\mu_r = \\mu_l = \\mu\n\\]\n\\[\n  H_a: \\mu_r \\neq \\mu_l\n\\]\n\nDoes the Eyes Used affect Reaction time?\n\nFactor: Eyes with levels \\(right\\)(r) and \\(left\\)(l). \\[\n  H_0: \\mu_r = \\mu_l = \\mu\n\\] \\[\n  H_a: \\mu_r \\neq \\mu_l\n\\]\n\nDoes the effect of Hand used change for different Eye Used? (Does the effect of Hand Used change for different levels of Eye Used?) In other words, is there an interaction between Hand Used and Eye Used?\n\n\\[\n  H_0: \\text{The effect of Hand Used is the same for any Eye used.}\n\\]\n\\[\n  H_a: \\text{The effect of Hand Used is not the same for any Eye used.}\n\\]\n\n\nTwo-way ANOVA\nA significance level of \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) will be used for this study.\nTo find the results for the hypothesis, we conducted the two-way ANOVA and the result is the below:\n\nmyaov &lt;- aov(Reaction_time ~ Hands + eyes + Hands:eyes, data=reactiont)\nsummary(myaov) %&gt;% pander()\n\n\nAnalysis of Variance Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\nPr(&gt;F)\n\n\n\n\nHands\n1\n2883\n2883\n8.133\n0.02142\n\n\neyes\n1\n2581\n2581\n7.282\n0.02714\n\n\nHands:eyes\n1\n21.33\n21.33\n0.06018\n0.8124\n\n\nResiduals\n8\n2836\n354.5\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the test above, we see a p-value output for each of the hypothesis stated. Any p-value that is less than the level of significance we that the factor is significant. The conclusions are that Hand Used is a significant factor \\((p=0.02142)\\), but Eyes Used does have a significant effect on reaction time \\((p=0.02714)\\), and the effect of Hand Used seems to NOT depend on the Eyes Used because the interaction term is not significant \\((p=0.8124)\\).\n\nDiagnostic Plots\nTo check if the results for this test are to be trusted, we would check the requirements to carry out this test. We created a plot of the residuals vs the fitted to check if the variance is constant. We also created a Q-Q plot of the Residuals to check the normallity of the error terms.\n\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nplot(myaov, which=1:2, pch=16)\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above graph, we see that the Q-Q plot of residual (graph to the right) looks good with all points close to the line, so we can say the error terms are normal. The graph of th residuals vs the fitted does not look very good because of the data points in the middle, but it is not enough to take it into consideration, so we would still assume that it has a constant variance.\n\n\n\nGraphical Summaries & Conclusions\nThe following graphics prove the results of each of the three hypothesis tests. They would also give additional on the relationship.\n\nHand Used\nThe below chart and table is to prove the finding of our test on Hand Used.\n\ndotplot(Reaction_time ~ Hands, data=reactiont, type=c(\"p\",\"a\"), main=\"Does the hand used affect reaction time?\", col='purple', xlab=\"Hands used\", ylab=\"Reaction time\") \n\n\n\n\n\nreactiont %&gt;%\n  group_by(Hands) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`Mean Reaction time`=mean(Reaction_time)) %&gt;%\n  pander(caption=\"Mean of each hand\")\n\n\nMean of each hand\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHands\nMean Reaction time\n\n\n\n\nLeft Hand\n294.7\n\n\nRight Hand\n263.7\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above chart and table verifies the finding of the test we carried out. The line in the chart is showing the average of the two factors. We can see that right hand has a lower average than left hand. This means that the hand used to take the reaction time test would affect the result. For our data set (Which is my personal results), right hand would give a lower reaction time.\n\n\nTension Level\nThe below chart and table is to prove the finding of our test on Eye Used.\n\ndotplot(Reaction_time ~ eyes, data=reactiont, type=c(\"p\",\"a\"), main=\"Does the eye used affect reaction time?\", col='orange', xlab=\"Eye used\", ylab=\"Reaction time\") \n\n\n\n\n\nreactiont %&gt;%\n  group_by(eyes) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`Mean Reaction time`=mean(Reaction_time)) %&gt;%\n  pander(caption=\"Mean of each eye\")\n\n\nMean of each eye\n\n\n\n\n\n\neyes\nMean Reaction time\n\n\n\n\nLeft eyes\n293.8\n\n\nRight eyes\n264.5\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above chart and table verifies the finding of the test we carried out. The line in the chart also shows the average of the two factors. We can see that right eyes has a lower average than left eyes.

For our data set (Which is my personal results), right eye would give a lower reaction time.\n\n\nTension Choices Depending on Wool Type\nThe below chart and table is to prove the finding of our test on the interaction between Hand Used and Eye Used.\n\ndotplot(Reaction_time ~ eyes, data=reactiont, groups=Hands, type=c(\"p\",\"a\"), main=\"Significance of the Interaction between hand and eye used\", auto.key=list(corner=c(1,1)))\n\n\n\n\n\nreactiont %&gt;%\n  group_by(Hands, eyes) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`Mean Reaction time`=mean(Reaction_time)) %&gt;%\n  pander(caption=\"Mean of each interaction between Hand Used and Eye Used\")\n\n\nMean of each interaction between Hand Used and Eye Used\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHands\neyes\nMean Reaction time\n\n\n\n\nLeft Hand\nLeft eyes\n308\n\n\nLeft Hand\nRight eyes\n281.3\n\n\nRight Hand\nLeft eyes\n279.7\n\n\nRight Hand\nRight eyes\n247.7\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above chart and table verifies the finding of the test we carried out. The line in the chart is showing the average reaction time of each hands for each eyes. We can see that line for both hands have lines similar and approximately parallel to each other. This means that the effect of hand used to take the reaction time test is the same for each eye."

    "text": "Introduction\nGlobally, breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women and ranks second in terms of mortality rates. The diagnosis process for breast cancer typically begins when an unusual lump is detected, either through self-examination or an x-ray, or when a small calcium deposit is observed on an x-ray. Once a suspicious lump is identified, a doctor will perform a diagnosis to ascertain if it is Malignant (cancerous) and whether it has metastasized to other parts of the body or if it is benign (not cancerous).\nThe purpose of the model being created is to detect accurately what type of tumor is found in the breast with the given features. The model will predict if the tumor is Malignant (cancerous).\nWhen a diagnosis is being done, ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:\n\nradius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)\ntexture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)\nperimeter (the measure of the core tumor)\narea (the measure of the breast tissue)\nsmoothness (local variation in radius lengths)\ncompactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)\nconcavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)\nconcave points (number of concave portions of the contour)\nsymmetry (how much of a proportion difference.)\nfractal dimension (“coastline approximation” - 1)"

Since the p-value for the change in y-intercept was positive (1.86e-24), SAAB cost more on average than Pontiac. We also conclude that there is a difference in the rate of price depreciation in both makes. Since the p-value of the change in slope is not zero, one vehicle make loses its value faster than the other."

We can see that the if both lines on the graph are extended they will touch the y-axis at different point, which means the y-intercepts are different. We can see that SAAB cars on average would cost more because the the y-intercept is higher than that of Pontiac. This also corresponds with the test results.\nIt is not as obvious, but We also see that the the slope of SAAB is steeper than the slope of Pontiac. Since both of them are going downwards and have negative slope, we see that the prices depreciate as we would expect. Because the slope of SAAB vehicles is steeper, it means that SAAB vehicles lost their value more with an increase in mileage. This also matches with the test results."
